# Chef Mistral

A simple cooking recipe recommendation website built with **React + Vite** and powered by **Hugging Faceâ€™s Mistral AI**.  
Just give the chef all that you have in your kitchen and discover new recipes!

Built while learning React from Bob Ziroll's course on Scrimba.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sock1000kg/ChefMistral`
2. Download dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Hugging Face token:
- Create a Hugging Face account
- Go to Settings -> Access Tokens
- Generate a new token (Just tick "Make calls to Inference Providers" if you only want to try this out)
- Copy the token (it only shows up when you first created it), and paste it into .env
4. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
